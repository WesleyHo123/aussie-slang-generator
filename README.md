This is a simple program centered around Australian slang

## Disclaimer
I acknowledge the use of claude ai (https://claude.ai) and ChatGPT (https://chatgpt.com) to: 
  - Find examples on working code
  - As a debugging tool to find logical and syntax errors
  - Suggest for more descriptive yet succinct names for functions and variables
  - Further understand the control flow of my code
  - Follow usual/best practices when coding in Python
  
I used prompts such as:
  - "slang_word, meaning = random.choice(list(aussie_slang.items()))", I want to turn this into multiple lines to be beginner-friendly"
  - "When I enter 'x', why is it not exiting the program?"
  - What is a "doc string" in python? How do I properly comment about functions?

The output from these prompts was used to:
  - Find a working solution and divide it into smaller bits of code to assist in learning and debugging
  - Understand where the error originating in my code
  - Supplement google search
  - Learn more on how to document code appropriately
